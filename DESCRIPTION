Description: Simultaneously finding multiple influential variables and 
    controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) for linear regression 
    models is a fundamental problem. This package provides three methods 
    about mirror (Gaussian mirror, data splitting and its multiple version) 
    to select features and control FDR at any nominal level.
